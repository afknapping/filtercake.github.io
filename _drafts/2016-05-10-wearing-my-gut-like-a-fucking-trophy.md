title: Wearing my gut like a fucking trophy
---


I'm out of shape. Not only do I huff and puff after running 2 minutes to catch the train. My gut is the proverbial life belt hanging over my pants — if I let it.

Most of the times I don't let it hang out though. I suck it in. Because god forbid somebody thinks I'm fat.

The thing is, **sucking in your gut fucks up your breathing**. Look into any book on exercising and you will find how deep belly breath is the basis for 
M
B everything else: [team sports](http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/breathe-playing-basketball-10985.html), meditation, [weights](http://www.builtlean.com/2013/02/14/breathe-weightlifting/), yoga, [swimming](http://swimming.about.com/od/swimworkoutsandskills/a/dbt_breathing.htm),...

Most of us in the first world breathe wrong. We breath with the top of our lungs. From kindergarten on we're told to suck in the gut and post out the chest to look more athletic and less like the slobs we all actually are.

Well, that is fucking us up. Some call that "[emergency breathing](http://www.anxieties.com/57/panic-step4#.VzGGRBV96Aw)". [The first thing you learn when dealing with anxiety is breathing correctly](http://www.anxietycoach.com/breathingexercise.html). Go figure.

I've decided to I've had it with that.

My wife and myself raised *twins* the past four years (and hope to continue of course). Show me the person with 4 year old twins who is *in shape*. I'm sure they exist of course, and I would like to know how they did it.

My point is: *that gut is something I will be proud of* from today on. Not because of how it looks. But because of what it represents. Because it tells me that I can prioritize. I decided to spent the little spare time left with my kids – and not in the gym, running after the perpetual, in-human, pride-driven, body-shaming money-machine we call [society](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170145/15138075/c6bdb3be-168d-11e6-9266-acc1cdd8545e.jpg).

I will *train* myself from today on to let my gut hang out and **wear it like a fucking trophy**. And if you see that and think "wow, that is a big gut" then FUCK YOU WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT YOUR LUKEWARM JUDGEMENT KTHXBAI!

In a couple months *I* will breathe like a sleeping baby all night and day while *you* will still [breathe in pain](https://www.painscience.com/articles/respiration-connection.php).

Who knows. It might become even easier to get into shape then ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
