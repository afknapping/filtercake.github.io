And suddenly, you are terrified.

You are way too late. While you were constantly busy, it looks like nothing has happened for weeks. Others have actually helped to make your life easier – they were nice to you. It's not like they have to do it or as if they do not have other work to do. They are waiting to finally see not just how it works – but how it looks.

They don't say anything. Yet. They respect your space and your authority. But if you miss your deadline, they will ask what the fuck you were doing all the time. And rightly so. You know that.

Then, suddenly, something happens that makes it all much more visible. Just a hint at the daily. Or the status of a ticket changes. Suddenly it is *fucking obvious* that you are the bottleneck. Suddenly there is that cold sweat on your forehead. Your heart is suddenly going that little faster than before.

Nothing changed though. The status is exactly the same as it was last week. Your plans on how you want to execute haven't changed either.

But suddenly, you are terryfied. As if suddenly all eyes were on you.

You might have a todo list, or a dozen todo lists. Three different project management tools. A Kanban board. A Pomodoro Timer. Or whatever.

But right now, none of them are helping. If they did, you weren't suddenly terrified. 

**So what do you do now?!**

Well, you start breaking it down.

You open a new text doc, and you start typing. Break it down until you have the first dependency-less task. And then break it even more down. **Make a task called *[looking at things](http://kimjongillookingatthings.tumblr.com/)* and give it the same 25 minimum minutes as all the other tasks!** I am not kidding.

You spent so much time setting it all up, thinking ahead, deciding how to move forward, reviewing code, writing emails, sketching on post its, understanding the problem, communicating with the team, explaining, meeting and whatnot. And now there are no 20 minutes to look at your own work? If it makes life easier for you, call it an "internal review" or something

They say "every marathon starts with the first step". Actually, nope, it doesn't. It starts with looking at the map to get an idea where the marathon is taking place and how the area is.

And suddenly the terror eases. You know you do not have to do anything. You just need to look at the thing and understand what you did so you can continue where you left the last time. Totally doable. Both simple *and* easy. Zero pressure. Zero deliverables.

Trust yourself that something will come up to continue work and show progress. Just by looking at things.
