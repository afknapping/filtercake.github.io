## If you build it right from the start...

...then the idea/feature/content will get all the praise and credit. What a great thing we made. What a good idea that was, and see how much value it produces. The users looooove it.

*You* don't even exist. Appreciation for UX work is low to non-existent. Actually, you are lucky not being considered blocking piece of overhead or a PITA.

There is nothing to do about that. The best UI is no UI. The best UX is the one your users don't even notice, the one which gets you through the job with [minimal cognitive cost](http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat).


## But let it being built broken first...

...and **then** fix it and **then** show numbers from A/B tests.

Guess what'll happen.

Now, I could *never, ever* bring myself to intentionally build broken shit. That is why I wrote "*let* it being built broken".

If I had to advise my son about how to be strategic and smart about this, I would take him aside and say:

"Just shut up and take notes and wait until it is deployed and metrics about the sucky UX are collected.

**Then** fix it."

## The awful truth

It pains me to write this, but my current conclusion is that UX is a hygiene factor. If stakeholders don't constantly get a tiny taste of how bad things are without it, they just forget. And the only taste business knows is numbers.

Does that mean it is on me to "do evangelism" and stuff? Maybe. But maybe I start to give a shit after a certain time.
