After taking place in Rome and Madrid during the past years, [Codemotion](codemotion) went to Berlin for the first time this year. So here is some feedback, followed by a couple of interesting sessions and all the links that somehow found their way into my notes.

## Feedback

- **Tickets** were very affordable and many were given away for free via usergroups, raffles and speakers. Besides, there was lots of free-for-all program for which you didn't even need a ticket.

- **Location:** I understand that working with a university spares you the huge chunk of location costs. However, needing more than an hour with public transport (including multiple train changes) from Berlin central to the location was a bit odd. Then again, finding *any* location not occupied at the Berlin Web Week is probably an achievement in itself.

- **The overall spirit** was great and open and the people always helpful and friendly.

- **The talks** were exactly the mixture I had hoped for. For once, they were not *that* high level all the time, which means you can come in late if the party took longer or just stay in the sun for an hour after lunch without missing some rockstar super-preso. On the other hand, whatever area of [creative] coding interests you, there was probably something there for you.

  I'd say what you get out of a program like this is all about expectations. I prefer to listen so somebody with little speaking experience and… uhm… maybe somewhat "bullety" slides, but bringing some enthusiasm with him/her. There is probably *something* interesting in every talk.

- **The food** was not that great. There was *way* too little water around.

- **To sum up**: All in all an awesome first edition, I loved it and I hope to go again next year! Having Codemotion in May and [Retune](http://retune.de) in October sounds just about perfect…
