title: Routines are about what happens between the tasks

I've been dabbling with routines now for about three years. So far routines have helped me to do the following things more or less consistently every morning: Get up early, meditate, do ~30 minutes of my very own blend of [Yin Yoga]() and [Yoga for Neck and Shoulders](), doodle and journal into my sketchbook while having my first coffee, drink much water (usually two large glasses, ~1 litre), make a smoothie or sth similarly healthy – and all or most of it before anybody else is even up.

All of that is awesome – but I still feel like like I'm "not there yet": I still do not have a consistent routine that plays like an autopilot from the moment I wake up.

I am currently working on getting my routine started immediately after waking up. No bathroom, no coffee, no checking mails. Wake up and do task #1 is where I want to get at.

It works kinda well so far (probably because I am finally following the rule of "only one thing at a time"). And I had a tiny epiphany.

A routine consists of three parts:

1. the tasks
2. the timeboxes for each task
3. the order of the tasks

Turns out, only 1. and 3. are important for the routine building.

**Routines are basically about what happens *in between* the tasks.** They define how you get from one task to the next. That is what needs to be automated. 

How long you actually exercise or meditate or have coffee does have severe impact. But not on how well or fast the routine becomes habit.
