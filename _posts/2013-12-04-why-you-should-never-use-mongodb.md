A very, *very* good explanation on how SQL and NoSQL data and stores work. Been looking for something like this for years!

## Moneyquote:

> When you have links between documents, you’ve outgrown MongoDB. [..] The *only* thing it’s good at is storing arbitrary pieces of JSON, [meaning] that you don’t care at all what’s inside that JSON. You don’t even look.

I'd like to add, though:
