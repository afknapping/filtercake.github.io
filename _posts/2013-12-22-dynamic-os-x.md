  - mavericks: 15 min http://osxdaily.com/2013/06/15/dual-boot-os-x-10-9-mavericks-and-os-x-10-8/
  - lib: 8
  - applications: 14 (incl some adobe monstrosities)

  => 40 gb
  => 80 + 25% => 100gb for 2 systems
  => 240 - 100 gb => 140 for essentials

define essentials



- 5 systems + essentials + frmd media + own media => 760
