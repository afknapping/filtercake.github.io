How I generated $1200 for the Free Software Foundation Europe (and not for the EFF)

Maybe you remember the enormous goto fail bug in February? It was a two-handed sword: while on the other hand unbelievable funny, it was also unbelievably dangerous. We couldn't know back then that Heartbleed was just around the corner. Apple did their part by letting us wait for a whole week until they rolled the OS X fix (piggy-backing another patch release).

Well, **TeeSpring exists!!11!**

TeeSpring allows you to upload a shirt design and have people pre-order it â€“ but it only gets printed if a threshold of orders is reached. So "Kickstarter for shirts", right? I love it, because it takes away all the hassle of making shirts: communication with printer, handling of adresses, handling of money, packaging, delivery. And the threshold makes sure the grunt work is only done if enough preorders are in.

So when I saw #gotofail trending on twitter (and people joking about how they want it as a shirt), I started doing a *very* basic design and put it up on TeeSpring.

I wasn't sure if it would reach the minimum of ten, and I hoped for 20 or 30. However, the idea to keep the money felt uncomfortable from the first minute. This was karma money. It was generated out of a somebody's mistake and the basic human fun to laugh at other people's fails (though I definitely think the real fail here was Apple not releasing a fix within *hours*).

Karma needs to be turned, amirite? So the money needed to be used for something positive. And there is a very simple way to use money for positive: give it to a non-profit. So giving it to the FSFE just seemed logical. They're doing great work.

Initially I wanted to split the money evenly between the FSFE and the EFF. But while the FSFE at least joined the Retweets a couple of days after the campaign launched, the EFF just didn't seem to care. Not at all. I even was in contact with one their members who told me he would forward it to the right people. Crickets.

I do not even want to think about how many shirts could have been sold, how much money could have been generated to fund the fight for free/libre software if somebody at the EFF would have given a tiny shit and sent out a couple tweets. This sadly has confirmed their reputation as sitting on a slightly higher horse than the rest of us. I will not renew my EFF membership and decided to have all the money paid out directly to the FSFE: more than $1200.
