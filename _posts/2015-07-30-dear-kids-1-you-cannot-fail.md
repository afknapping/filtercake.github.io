Dear Kids.

I am not sure yet what kind of notes I will write. Or how many of them.

But every day I fear that I get under a bus and that all those moments are lost like tears in the rain*.

I am not delusional though: I cannot ever transfer any of my own learnings to you. But maybe, just maybe, I can inspire you to experiment and generate your own learnings. Maybe I can inspire you to try out more things, and faster. 

I have spent a lot of my early years wading in self-pity and misery. I don't regret that — at the time it seemed to have some value. But sometimes I wonder where I could be today if I had tackled my issues earlier and with more focus.

Maybe I can inspire you to listen more, both inside and outside. Get more input, more feedback. You will always have to make your own decisions anyway. But the more informed they are, the better they still feel a couple years after making them.

In your 20s, little of this is of relevance. For example, very few people had kids around the time I was in my 20s. Now in my 30s, that is turning around massively. Suddenly, decisions you made ten years ago start to rear their ugly head. 

Well, whatever. This initial post should at least have *one* real point. And that point is:

## You cannot fail!

Life is not about winning or losing, achiving or failing.

You will die. Naked and and alone. Every living thing does.

A minute enjoyed is a good minute. A minute fighting is a waste. 

There are no mistakes, just learnings.

Failing is not possible. It doesn't matter if you die successful or rich or poor or alone or amongst a large family.

Life is basically pointless, so enjoying it is the only thing that makes sense. Arguing, fighting, worrying — those things help nobody. Not you, not the people around you.

Do whatever is necessary to enjoy your life. And as long as you don't affect others in a negative way: don't compromise on happiness.

Have a great life! You deserve it. And what else is there really to do?


\* Aside: Blade Runner might not actually be as visionary to you as it has been to my parents or myself. When you think about it, movies like Ex Machina, Splice or Her are still exploring the exact same topic. But I might talk about Blade Runner another time.
