I hurt my ankle last week, torn ligature. I didn't get it at first, but the doctor put me on sick leave for a whole week.

Thing is now, that it would be really easy to take part in work remotely. All the more since I actually like my job, I care about the current project a lot and am surrounded by awesome poeple.

But as I said to others again and again: doctors have a reason why they excempt you from work. So when you're out, you're out.

Don't answer the chat, don't answer mails, don't post into tickets. It takes discipline.

And if you see stuff breaking or going sideways while you're gone â€“ there is your lesson on black-boxing and truck-factoring. Improve that in the future. For now, it is too late.

Luckily I log and paste all the bits and pieces of my work in tickets AND we pair a lot. What actually got "lost" because of my accident is just a couple hours of work. Hooray for pairing and full transparency.
