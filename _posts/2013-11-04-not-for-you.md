Yeah, so... I spent a lot of time in the last two years tweaking my [Toto blog](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto), then my [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) blog to finally get the gist of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

That was nice and I learned a lot. About Ruby, about SASS and Compass. About static blogging, Markdown and Github. Cool.

But I finally want to write again. Not for you to read it. Just for me to write it. To remind me of the all the things I learned the hard way. Or to formulate a thesis and find out if it actually has some pudding. Or to be pushed to get some effing *content* online and decide on how it should look like *later*.

So I just deleted everything, typed `jekyll new filtercake` and here we go.

I hereby commit to write at least one post per week with a maximum of 500 words.

Feel much better now.
