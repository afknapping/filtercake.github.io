As I briefly mentioned in [the Yin Yoga post](/yin-yoga/), I suffered an acute hearing loss some days before Christmas 2016. I got lucky and most of the symptoms disappeared within a week. But I took the episode as huge warning shot and decided to set health and healing as **Priority 1™**.

New year resolutions have never worked for me. But I came along this idea of having a *theme* for a year. So **2016 is the year of health and healing**.

Here's what I did in telegram style. I could write a whole post about each bullet point, but for now the bird's eye view has to do...


## Pulling the breaks (Dec 20 to Jan 3)

- stopped everything
- took long walks
- talked to friends and family
- found out how to have relaxed time *with* the kids, instead of perceiving it as a constant cat-herding task (this sounds worse than it is – we're still recovering from the first two years of having twins and often our buttons are still pushed by minor things...)
- collected all health related ideas in a huge bucket list (ongoing)
- got into continous observer mode to catch automated behaviour and its triggers
- started to do [kitchen Mise en place – Wikipedia](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place) in the evenings
- looked into TaiChi and Yoga
- made a health folder on my phone homescreen to collect useful apps
- decided to try out as much as feels good in the first 6 weeks of 2016 and and analyze after, and continue that pattern through the rest of the year

To re-use terms I'm familiar with, I'm calling these periods "sprints".


## Sprint 1 (Jan 4 to Feb 14)

- simplified and reduced my morning routine to sth I can safely commit to doing every day.
- got into [Yin Yoga](/yin-yoga/)
- got off track by writing a "useless" custom mobile offline-first timer web app – which was good fun and i learned a lot (eg how to DIY a poor man's [Redux]() in jQuery ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )
- did so much Yin Yoga that I needed to take a rest (two long sessions per day is a bit much for a noob)
- cut back work to 90%
- got granted 1,5 days remote work per week which with the 90% time results in just being three days per week at the office. This reduces my commute *a lot* – roughly 6 hours per week. (Remote working is very out of norm at Jimdo, and I'm really grateful for this!)
- did meditate more often for longer periods of time
- bought [a good water tracker](http://waterminderapp.com/) which helps me to keep my water intake above the recommended ~3.0 litres per day
- looked a bit into the body's acid/alkaline balance, did some ph tests, decided to shelve that topic for later
- started to put first easy exercising into morning routine
- started going to bed before 22h consistently to guarantee 7+ hours of sleep
- started reading 15% of a book each day so I read regularly and can finish one book per week (not seeing it as task though – reading is fun and relaxing)
- observe if and how a health budget of *10% of waking time* might work. That budget would be for both mental and physical health, so drawing and reading for example are part of it.
- never [re-installed twitter and tumblr](https://twitter.com/filtercake/status/677157220065353728) on my phone
- started taking ginko which has a good track record of helping tinitus (I've kept a tiny one from the hearing loss)
- did a couple weeks of [Kinesio Tape](http://science.howstuffworks.com/kinesiology-tape.htm) (ongoing)
- finally made and attended the dentist appoinent i was procrastinating for more than a year
- started fixing my blog setup so writing is simpler. Writing helps me lot on getting a clear view. Used blot last year before, now back to Jekyll (missed it as a learning device, for example am now using a custom build so I have plugins and can play with [the poor man's deployment](https://github.com/filtercake/filtercake.github.io/blob/src/deploy.sh))
- skimmed through dozens of books on health related topics (mostly yoga)
- freshed up ergonomics, eg tested chairs, switched to my [Roost Laptop Stand](http://www.therooststand.com/) at home, currently testing [an ergonomic keyboard](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00DT88OXK)


# Benefits of Sprint 1

- I am much more positive and start catching more and more negative behaviour patterns. 
- I have more energy and feel less tired
- I sleep better
- I became much more sensitive to my needs and how I feel which helps to not overdo things, get regular rests and breaks, further seperate personal and work life, etc

# Commitments

These are the things that I feel I can safely commit to from today on:

- do my 3x15 routine each morning: 15 minutes braindumping, sketching, having my first coffe, 15 minutes meditation, 15 minutes light exercising (for now mostly neck, arms, shoulders, upper back)
- a longer Yin Yoga session every other day (if that sounds interesting to you, get [the original book by Paul Grilley](http://www.amazon.de/Yin-Yoga-Principles-Practice-Anniversary/dp/1935952706/)
- drink at least 3 litres of water each day
- do a light kitchen [Mise en place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place)  
- be asleep at 22h every night

I use an app called [Commit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/commit/id473527073?mt=8) to track this.


# Sprint 2 (theme: food)

For the next sprint I want to focus on what I shove into my mouth all the time (and in the mouths of my family):

- find what to cook, how to plan, when to shop
- try out more natural supplements (the buzzword is "superfoods")
- reduce coffee, replace with hot water and nettle tea
- exercise regularly and try sprinting every morning
- do some simple gardening and get back on the longboard as soon as the  weather permits
- visit the orthopedian (procrastinating for two years) 
- switch to shorter 28 day cycles for sprints

Start is Feb 14.

If you're actually still reading – thx for time and don't hesitate to ask me about stuff. DMs are open :)
