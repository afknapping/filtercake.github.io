title: Make what sells
---

The usual most people I met think about business is this:

> I have this teriffic idea. I will build it, then I will sell it.

Although that feels natural, it is actually completely backwards. It is the reason that so many startups and small businesses fail. It is the reason that so many projects with an assumed potential to generate money are left to rot half-done.

What makes sense, is this:

- find a large enough market
- ask the people in that market what problem they would pay for having solved
- pre-sell your solution
- make the product from the pre-sales money

This might sound like a lot of theory. It certainly does to *me*, because I haven't built a business like this yet. I might not want to build a business.

What I certainly *can* say from the past, is that all the advertising and marketing annoyance we have to deal with, is coming from building products that do not solve a problem. They are created without need. Then we add advertising to artificially create an emotional need in the hope that people buy on that.

It is also part of why commercial art is such an ambivalent and difficult thing. On the one hand you do not compromise your art. On the other, the more you do, the more monetary-successful you will be ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Don't believe me, though. All I did was five years of reading. All theory, no action.

All "products" I have made so far, were of the I-love-my-idea-and-it-is-fun-to-build-it kind. But that is not business. That is art.

The good part about selling art is, that you cannot loose. Making art is an intrinsic need. If you only make $10 from it, that is still very cool. 99.99% of all art created doesn't ever make a single cent.

Also, selling *something* can teach you a lot about sales, marketing, customer care, process, invoicing, payment, negotiating, travelling, ecommerce, etc., asf...

Selling is not selling out. You can sell what you made, no harm done. The point in art is *making it* and you already did that.

But if you want to sell something, as in "at least feed the family", then **make something that sells**.
